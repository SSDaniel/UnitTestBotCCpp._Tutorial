## What is
UnitTestBot (aka UTBot) tool provides engineers with a simple 1-mouse-click way to automatically generate unit tests and visualize coverage for projects written in C and C++ Programming Languages. It is an IDE extension (the client) paired with server application. The tool uses symbolic execution for test cases generation. UTBot uses KLEE Symbolic Virtual Machine enchanced with a new advanced bidirectional symbolic execution algorithm developed by Research Group from Saint Petersburg State University. Tests are generated in form of Google Test Framework.
